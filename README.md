### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Scott** (he/him), a developer specialising in [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org), [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org), with further knowledge in [Swift](https://swift.org) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) plus a smattering of other languages.

Previous companies have included [ThisIsONE](https://thisisone.tv), [Kyan](https://kyan.com), [Spyscape](https://spyscape.com), [TRX](https://trx.tv), [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/) and [The Stage](https://thestage.co.uk/).

Clean, understandable code is my passion. Some talks I've given around the subject:

- [Calling in the cops: Applying RuboCop to legacy codebases](https://youtu.be/Cd1aLLwTNKc) 
- [Hack like a journalist: Structuring code to be read](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6984-hack-like-a-journalist)
